    Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking the squares with their symbols (either X or O). The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.
<ol style="font-size: large;">
    <li>Draw a 3x3 grid on a piece of paper or use a Tic Tac Toe app.</li>
    <li>Decide which player will go first.</li>
    <li>The first player marks an empty square on the grid with their symbol (either X or O).</li>
    <li>The second player then takes their turn and marks another empty square with their symbol.</li>
    <li>Players continue to take turns until one player gets three of their symbols in a row or all squares are marked and there is no winner.</li>
    <li>If a player gets three of their symbols in a row, they win the game. If all squares are marked and there is no winner, the game is a tie.</li>
